# Python API for Receipts Scanner

This API provides the image processing and item categorization functionality for Receipts Scanner.

## Local development

Build a docker image:

- `docker build -t model .`

Run a docker container from the built image:

- `docker run -p 8000:80 model`

## CI
By pushing code to `master` branch, the Docker image is automatically built thanks to the
`.github/workflows/python-apl.yml` pipeline. It is then published to Azure Container Registry. From there, it is
deployed to Azure Container Instances.

The Python API service is available on http://pythonapi.westeurope.azurecontainer.io/.

Documentation of endpoints (generated by Postman) is
available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9355808/TzJsfdUK).

### Logs

Logs are available at Azure Portal -> aci-python-api -> Containers -> Logs.
